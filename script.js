// This file is now used to initialize the application

document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', (event) => {
    console.log('DOM fully loaded and parsed');
    // Any initialization code that needs to run after the DOM is loaded can go here
});

// If there's any global state or functions that need to be accessible across all files,
// they can be defined here. However, we've tried to minimize global state by organizing
// the code into separate files.
